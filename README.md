# Analysis with API's, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Google Places API (Data Wrangling, Data Manipulation, API's)


The purpose of this website is to showcase how different weather variables can affect the behaviour of the climate in different cities around the world.

The analysis was made by retrieving, manipulating and analyzing an open-to-public API called "The Weather API".

Firstly, an account was created in such website providing a unique API Key used to get access to the information and make it possible to manipulate it for the further analysis.

The tool used to make the data wrangling was a Jupyter Notebook along with the Pandas, Matplotlib libraries using Python as the coding language and Google Places API. The idea was to plan a holiday trip in such a manner that parameters inputed by the user served to search and find the cities that best fitted in with those characteristics. 

Some of the optional parameters entered into the code were:
                            Minimum temperature
                            Maximum temperature
                            Latitude
                            Longitude
                            Precipitation
                            Humidity
                       
The final result consisted in that the resulting cities among those 500 searched are displayed in a world map. Using Google Places API top hotels in those selected cities showed once the user hovers over the marks displayed on the map. Specifics of the hotels were displayed such as: rating, price range, address and photos of the venue.
